1. In today's session we saw the importance of Pod,Replica Set ,EKS(Elastic Kubernetes Services)and launching wordpress and mysql using CLI.
2. Replica Set ensures how many replica of pod should be running. It can be considered as a replacement of replication controller. The key difference between the replica set and the replication controller is, the replication controller only supports equality-based selector whereas the replica set supports set-based selector.
2.1 Replica set mainly uses both Set-based selectors and controller-based selector.
3. The Concept of creating replica set(RS) using "rs.yml".The concept of accessing to the Kubernetes cluster from the kubectl by using the exec keyword.
4. kubernetes never manage operating system or virtual machines it  manages Docker.
5. Setting env variables and making them permanent.
5.1  launching Wordpress and mysql using CLI and configuring it .
6. Some of the commands are as follows:-
kubectl expose  rs  wprs  --type = Nodeport   --port =80
kubectl  exec -i  -t  rsweb1-dsngp  --bash
kubectl -it  mypod1  --bash
and many more.
