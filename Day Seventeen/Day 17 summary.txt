1. In today's session we saw the importance of Elastic load Balancer(ELB) in AWS,Service and types of services in kubernetes ,DMZ
1.1 DMZ :- DMZ enables access to some systems from an external network .
1.2 Uses of kustomize tool are as follows:-,customizing resources ,generating resources from other resources.
2. Elasic Load Balancer is a purpose built service for distributing workloads.Elastic Load Balancing scales traffic to an application as demand changes over time. 
3. Elastic Load Balancing can also be used in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud  to distribute traffic between application tiers in a virtual network that you define.
4. K8s Service(logical sets of pods) can be defined as an abstraction on the top of the pod which provides a single IP address and DNS name by which pods can be accessed. 
5. With K8s Service, it is very easy to manage load balancing configuration. It helps pods to scale very easily.
5.1  We learned various other concepts such as  threshold created from metrics of the webserver which is monitored by cloud watch in AWS, creation of  a program for LB, we allocate the IP and port to the LB program where client  is connected to -->program is connected to-->container.Round robin is used behind the seen for L.B.
5.2 Types of services are as follows:-
Cluster IP :- Cluster IP helps in restricting the service within the cluster. It exposes the service within the defined K8s cluster.
Nodeport :- Nodeport expose the service on a static port on the deployed node. 
Load Balancer :-LB service type exposes the service externally using the load balancer of your cloud provider. 
6. Some of the commands  are as follows:- 
>kubectl get svc
>kubectl run webpod --image=vimal13/apache-webserver-php
>kubectl label pods webpods dc=IN
>kubectl get all
and many more.
