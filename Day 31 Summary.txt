1. In today's session we got to know about Right Use cases of Ansible and terraform tools,
 AWS ELB and types of ELB and also setup a Classic Load Balancer architecture.
1.1 Elastic load balancer used to manage load balancer is an aws service. It is an subservice of ec2 instance.
2.There are two ways to create ELB which are as follows:-
-->Can create own L.B (Haproxy)
-->Managed Service.
3.The purpose of Load Balancer is to balance the incoming traffic & increase the performance of application. 
4.There are 3 advantages of using Load Balancer
1. No need to assign Public IP to EC2 instances , hence its secure
2. Launching EC2 instances in multiple AZ will help in Disaster Recovery (DR)
3. Client need to be aware of IP of only Load Balancer rather than IPs of EC2 instances.

5.There are 3 types of Load Balancers
1. Classic Load Balancer-    supports HTTP/HTTPS, TCP traffic,free.
2. Network Load Balancer :  used for heavy loads & high performance,not free.
3. Application Load Balancer - This also supports HTTP/HTTPS and TCP traffic,free.

6.To setup L.B , we need to launch EC2 instances.
While launching instances we can provide a script to set up apache webserver using linux commands , in user data section.
!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y ( install apache webserver on Ec2 instance without prompting)
echo  '<pre> <?php print(`ifconfig`) ?> >/pre>' > /var/www/html/index.html ( this will set up web page )
service httpd start ( to start apache webserver).

7.Terraform will be able to contact kubernetes only if cluster is configured.
