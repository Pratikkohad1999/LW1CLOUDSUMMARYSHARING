1. In today's session we saw the importance of Kubelet,kube scheduler,kubeadm,kube Api,kubeproxy and creation of multi-node k8s cluster(using RHEL-8 CLI VM as an O.S for master and slave nodes).
2. Configuring the environment first then setup lots of configuration like installing RHEL 8.0(Iso file) then configuring yum then setup kubectl  in different different slaves 
3. Setting up kubelet in all of the master and slaves.Setting up kubelet, kubeadm, kube Schedular, Apiserver, Kubecontroller in Multi-node Cluster of K8s. 
4. Concept of  token provided by the master vm for K8s.Setting up the Flannel for Network in master K8s.  Using token provided by the Master to connect the slave to master .
5. Kubeadm:- fast paths for creating Kubernetes clusters
     kubeproxy:-maintains network rules on nodes.
     kubelet:- Manages the control plane components.(executes instruction) 
     KubeApi:-validate and configures data
     etcd - etcd is an open source distributed key-value store used to hold and manage the critical information. 
kube scheduler:-Schedules pods
6. Some of the linux commands  are as follows:- 
>kubectl get pods -n  kube-system
>kubectl get nodes  --kubeconfig config
>kubectl get nodes
and many more.
