1. In today's session we saw the importance of Nova,Virtualization,Hypervisor and how to Launch an instance on Openstack from CLI.
2. Nova – It handles the Virtual machines at compute level and performs other computing task at compute or hypervisor level.
2.1 Neutron – It provides the networking functionality to VMs, Compute and Controller Nodes.
3. Nova (Compute) Cloud comprises following components: API server,Message Queue,,(Rabbit-MQ Server),Compute Workers (Nova-Compute),Network controller (Nova-Network),Volume Worker and Scheduler
4.Virtualization   allows you to use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.
5. In virtualization technology,hypervisor is a software program that manages muitiple O.S(or muitiple instances of the same O.S) on a single computer system.
Types of hypervisor that Openstack supports are:- KVM,Containers,Xen and HyperV and VMware.
6. QEMU(open source) is a type 2 hypervisor that runs within user space and performs virtual hardware emulation.
7. Various cmd in linux are as follows:-
>nova service-list
>neutron net-list
>nova flavor-list
and many more.
