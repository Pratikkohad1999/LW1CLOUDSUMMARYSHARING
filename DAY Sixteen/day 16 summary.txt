1.In today's session we saw the importance of Persistent volume(PV),Persistent volume claim(PVC) and Secret.
2.Persistent Volume :-A type of Volume that lives within the Kubernetes cluster, and can outlive other Kubernetes pods to retain data for long periods of time.
3.A persistent volume offers persistent storage that enables your data to remain intact, regardless of whether the containers to which the storage is connected are terminated.
4.A PersistentVolumeClaim is a request for a resource with specific attributes, such as storage size.A PersistentVolumeClaim is used by a pod as a volume. 
when we delete or restart pod data,the data inside it gets deleted so we use pvc to make that data permanent.
5.PVC are of two types:-1.Static 2.Dynamic
5.1 Secret:- Secret is an objects used to store sensitive data such as user name and passwords with encryption.Ways of creation of secrets in kubernetes are as follows:- creation from txt files and creation from yaml file.
5.2 Learned about creation of secret using terraform.
6.Some of the commands  are as follows:- 
>kubectl get pvc
>kubectl delete pvc --all
>kubectl get pv
>kubectl get sc 
and many more.
