1.In today's session we saw the importance of  Terraform Provisioners 
2.Provisioners are used for executing scripts or  commands on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation/deletion.
3.We saw the importance of both local-exec and remote-exec Provisioners.
4.local-exec provisioner helps run a script on instance where we are running our terraform code, not on the resource we are creating.
5.for ex:-provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${aws_instance.testInstance.public_ip} >> public_ip.txt"
  }
} 
5.remote-exec provisioner helps invoke a script on the remote resource once it is created.We can’t provide any arguments to script in remote-exec provisioner.
6.Cloning Url from our own github repository.
7.If we want to run without any resource, we can use “null resource”.
8.Various commands in terraforms are as follows:-terraform validate,terraform init,terraform destroy,terraform apply and many more.
