1. In today's session we saw the importance of Bastion Host(JumpBox),Uses of Bastion Host,Ingress/inbound rule,egress/outbound rule,security groups in AWS,NAT gateway and Creation of  NAT Gateway in AWS.
2. Security Groups:-SG is like a  firewall which is controlling the traffic to your EC2 instances.You can apply multiple security groups to a single EC2 instance or apply a single security group to multiple EC2 instances.
3.If you don't specify a security group, EC2 uses the default security group.
4. Inbound rules means control the  incoming traffic coming to your EC2 instances. For that you have to add inbound rule. 
5. Outbound rules  means control the outgoing traffic from your EC2 instances. To connect internet or any browser you have to add outbound rule. 
6. Outbound rules means you initiate the connection and the traffic starts flowing outward of your computer to the provided destination  .
7. NAT gateway is used to enable instances present in a private subnet to help connect to internet.They donâ€™t support IPV4 traffic. NAT gateway is not a free service, it charges upto $0.045per/hour.
8.Bastion Host reduces the risk of attacks on an infrastructure. It is used to manage EC2 instances using SSH or RDP securely. Bastion hosts are also known as jump boxes.
9.If you SSH or RDP to an instance in a private subnet, you need to configure a Bastion host. You cannot use NAT Gateway as a Bastion host.
10.Discussed about minions/slave(The machines that acts as workers/slave),Attaching and detaching public ip to instance and Launching instance and adding firewall to MySQL.
