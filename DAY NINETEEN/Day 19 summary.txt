1. In today's session we saw the importance of Openstack(how to setup openstack private cloud),diff b/w AWS and openstack,Self service and Abstraction layer in Cloud Computing,Creation of Yum server,relevance of RHOSP 13 with Openstack queen version.
1.1 OpenStack is an open source platform that uses pooled virtual resources to build and manage private and public clouds.for ex:-HP uses HP-helien its own cloud made using openstack.
 cloud1.2 OpenStack is used for creating and maintaining a cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
2. AWS-  AWS is not opensource, how it works internally, we can't able to know. We can only use it as an user. This makes a difference with OpenStack.After particular amount of time ,it charges on its service.The first conceptual difference between AWS and OpenStack is about multi-tenancy.
OpenStack-It is also a platform where we can perform the tasks that aws provides. But OpenStack is an opensource platform. We can create our own cloud and customize things according to our needs.  
3. The abstraction layer will allow users to manipulate VM as objects and simplify the process of porting applications to cloud computing. 
4. Self-service is the service, where the user can go and request for required resources.
5.creation of yum server.
6.OpenStack Queens, the 17th version offers emerging use cases like containers, NFV, edge computing and machine learning.
