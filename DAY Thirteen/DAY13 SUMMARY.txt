1. In today's session we saw the importance of Pod, brief overbiew of YAML language which is used in kubernetes , controller(Replication Controller and replica set)and some difference between JSON and YAML Language.
2.kubernetes have two types of controllers for fault tolerance: RC and RS
A replication controller is one of the features of Kubernetes that you'll interact with on a regular basis to launch one or more instances of your applications. 
3.  A replication controller(old version) is a structure that enables you to easily create multiple pods, then make sure that that number of pods always exists. when pod crashes RC is used as a replacement.
4.IP changes tags never changes.To configure  kubernetes by code we have to use YAML language or terraform HCL.
5.Concept of launching the pods from the YAML code and also launch the replica controller.
6. Some of the commands are as follows:-
kubectl label pods myweb dc=IN
kubectl get pods   --show-labels
kubectl label pods myweb2  dc=US
and many more.
